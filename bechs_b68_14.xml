 <head>Biographical Note </head> 
 <bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
 <head>James A. Roberts, 1847-1938</head> 
 <p>A Buffalo and New York City lawyer and financier, Roberts was born
 in Waterboro, York County, Maine in 1847. He served in the Civil War in the 7th
 Maine Battery from 1864 to 1865 before entering Bowdoin College. He earned an
 A.B. from Bowdoin in 1870, an A.M. in 1873, and an LL.D. in 1898. From the time
 he was admitted to the bar in 1875 until 1894, Roberts practiced law in
 Buffalo. He was a member of the New York State Assembly, 1879-1880, and Buffalo
 Parks Commissioner, 1891-1893. In 1894, he left Buffalo to serve as New York
 State comptroller until 1899. From 1902 to his death, Roberts lived in New York
 City. He was married twice, to Minnie Pineo in 1871 and to Martha Dresser in
 1884. </p> 
 </bioghist> 
 <bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
 <head>Frank St. John Sidway, 1869-1938 </head> 
 <p>A prominent figure in legal, military, and civic affairs in Buffalo
 and a member of an early Buffalo family, Frank S. Sidway was related to James
 A. Roberts by his marriage to Roberts' daughter Amelia in 1903. Sidway was the
 son of Franklin Sidway (1834-1920), a Buffalo merchant and banker.</p> 
 <p>Frank S. Sidway was educated at Buffalo public schools and Phillips
 Exeter Academy (N.H.). He enrolled at Harvard College in the class of 1893 but
 left before graduating. He then attended the University of Buffalo Law School,
 where he received his degree in 1894. After studying law in the offices of
 Lewis, Moot and Lewis, he practiced for three years in the firm of Sprague,
 Moot, Sprague and Brownell. From 1897 until his death, Sidway practiced law
 privately. He developed an extensive clientele, and his practice was
 substantially devoted to real estate investments.</p> 
 <p>Sidway's military career began in 1894 when he was commissioned a
 second lieutenant in the 74th Infantry Regiment of the New York National Guard;
 by 1897 he had been promoted to captain. In 1898, in the war with Spain, he was
 commissioned a captain in the 202nd New York Infantry Regiment; he raised a
 company within weeks and was one of the first captains mustered into U.S.
 service. Sidway and his regiment sailed for Cuba and fought through the entire
 campaign; they were the first U.S. troops to enter Havana. On his return to the
 U.S. in 1899, he was mustered out, but later was elected captain of the 74th
 infantry. He resigned that commission in 1902. His military career resumed
 during World War I, when he was made a major of the depot battery of the 74th
 Regiment. In 1917, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, Sidway organized the
 command that replaced the regular regiment after it was mobilized.</p> 
 <p>As an attorney, he was responsible for all Sidway family interests
 in Buffalo, including the management of the Sidway building at Main and Goodell
 Streets. He was vice-president of Robertson Cataract Electric Company and
 chairman of the Erie County Republican Committee (1909-1910). He also served as
 president of the Building Manufacturers Association (1926-1927) and the Main
 Street Association (1936-1937), and was a member of the New York State
 Historical Society, the Buffalo Historical Society, as well as several social
 and fraternal organizations.</p> 
 </bioghist> 
 <bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
 <head>Franklin Sidway, 1834-1920</head> 
 <p>The father of Frank S. Sidway, Franklin Sidway was born in Buffalo.
 After returning from European travels in 1853, he organized the Buffalo firm of
 Sidway, Skinner &amp; Moore, general ship chandlers and grocers. This firm
 ceased operations sometime during the Civil War. During the war he was
 commissioned a colonel with authority to raise a regiment; Sidway recruited
 many companies of soldiers but they were later transferred to another regiment.
 He married Charlotte Spaulding, the daughter of E.G. Spaulding, who was
 president of Farmers and Mechanics National Bank. Sidway became a cashier in
 the bank and later served as vice-president until 1898. He was a trustee of
 Buffalo Savings Bank and Forest Lawn Cemetery, as well as president of the
 Buffalo and Falconwood Clubs. In addition to a son, Frank S., Franklin Sidway
 had a daughter, Mrs. Edith Gardner.</p> 
 </bioghist> 
 <bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
 <head>Elbridge Gerry Spaulding, 1809-1897</head> 
 <p>Lawyer, banker, alderman, mayor, assemblyman, state treasurer, and a
 three-term member of Congress, E.G. Spaulding had a distinguished and varied
 career. He studied law in Batavia and came to Buffalo in 1834, eventually
 entering into successive partnerships with George R. Babcock, Herman B. Potter,
 and John Ganson. About the time he retired from the legal progression (1848),
 Spaulding was instrumental in moving Farmers and Mechanics Bank from Batavia to
 Buffalo; soon thereafter he became its president and remained in that position
 all his active life.</p> 
 <p>Spaulding began his career in public life as city clerk in 1836. In
 1841, as an alderman, he served as chairman of the city's finance committee; he
 was elected mayor of Buffalo in 1847; he entered the state assembly in 1848,
 where he was chairman of the Canal Committee; and he was elected to the 31st
 U.S. Congress in 1849. In 1853, Spaulding served as state treasurer and was
 active for several years on the Republican State Central Committee. In 1858, he
 was again elected to the House of Representatives, serving in both the 36th and
 37th U.S. Congresses during the critical period of the Civil War. He is most
 widely known as "Father of the Greenback" for his initiative on the House Ways
 and Means Committee in overseeing the passage of bills he introduced in
 Congress to issue new U.S. treasury notes during the Civil War.</p> 
 <p>Spaulding owned a 315-acre farm, "River Lawn", on Grand Island. He
 was the father of two sons, Edward R. and Samuel S. Spaulding, and a daughter,
 Charlotte Spaulding, who married Franklin Sidway.</p>
