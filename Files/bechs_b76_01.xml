 <head>J.D. Larkin and the Larkin Soap Company</head> 
 <p>J. D. Larkin and Company was incorporated May 1, 1875 in Buffalo,
 N.Y. Its founder was born John Durrant Larkin on 29 September 1845, to English
 immigrant parents, in Buffalo. Eleven years later, Elbert Hubbard was born. In
 the 1870's, Hubbard was to join Larkin as his first salesman, rising in later
 years to become head of the Sales department and, later, Secretary and
 Treasurer of the company's board of directors and a partner in the firm. J. D.
 Larkin also married Hubbard's sister Hannah.</p> 
 <p>In the 1870's young J. D. Larkin entered into a Chicago soap firm
 that in 1871 branched out for him in the firm's partnership. Eventually he set
 out on his own to found a soap empire. His main office and first factory were
 situated in Buffalo; branch operations were soon established in New York,
 Peoria (Ill.), Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Memphis
 (although branch factories such as those in Memphis were short lived due to
 improving freight and mail transportation). Larkin began as a soap producer and
 manufacturer (read also: chemist, refiner, and perfumer), forming a board of
 directors which, after the turn of the century, produced some of western New
 York's most prominent families. </p> 
 <p>W. H. and D. J. Coss joined the firm in 1875 as Superintendent and
 Assistant Superintendent, respectively, of the Larkin factories until their
 retirements in 1909. In 1876, a three-story plant was constructed for soap
 production at 663 Seneca St. Darwin D. Martin joined the firm in 1878 and in
 that same year; Elbert Hubbard became a partner in the firm. The first Larkin
 product was a yellow laundry soap whose price and effectiveness made the firm
 famous. By 1881 the J. D. Larkin &amp; Co. organization was marketing soap
 powder. Inside their soap boxes they enclosed a buying incentive: paper
 premiums that could be redeemed for free gifts. This idea has since been
 applied by several cereal and detergent companies, in addition to the famous S
 &amp; H Green Stamps and Brand Names Treasure Chest promotions. </p> 
 <p>In 1883 Larkin and Company began to manufacture toilet soap; from
 then on the Larkin letterhead would read, "Producers of Soap of every
 description and kind, Boraxine, Modjeska, toilet preparations, and chemically
 pure Glycerine." Two years later, Larkin's enterprises occupied over one acre
 in the city of Buffalo.</p> 
 <p>Elbert Hubbard became the company's troubleshooter and innovator,
 and it was mainly through his creativity that J. D. Larkin decided to initiate
 a mail order business. Hubbard was also responsible for the diversification of
 the factory-to-family idea, which reduced overhead from retailers, wholesalers,
 and distributors -- and increased profits. Larkin products were also sold
 door-to-door (much like modern-day Avon products) by housewives and school
 children. By 1886, Hubbard had convinced the firm to market a Larkin
 "Combination Box." which contained l00 bars of soap along with premiums and
 enclosed gifts that couldn't be bought in other stores for the original price
 of the soap ($6). A thirty-day period was allowed to pay for the purchase; this
 policy was considered outrageous in these days before installment spending and
 customer credit. Combination Box sales continued until 19l0. Sales of the boxes
 were so brisk that the traditional bound ledgers became out-moded and a system
 using index cards was introduced. The card ledger system, since copied by
 countless other companies, was a Larkin creation; Darwin D. Martin even
 published a booklet, 
 <title type="book">Making A Card Ledger</title>, about the genesis of
 the idea. After being paid, all cards (bills) were not thrown away but rather
 retained to become the nucleus for a customer mailing list. This last was an
 idea of Elbert Hubbard's. </p> 
 <p>The 1892 Board of Directors consisted of J. D. Larkin, St.
 (President); Elbert Hubbard (Secretary and Treasurer); and Charles H. Larkin
 (Vice-President). On 22 February 1892 the Larkin Soap Manufacturing Company was
 organized with a capitalization of $500,000. In 1893 the first catalog was
 published, listing free premiums; soon to be published annually by 1909, the
 catalog became so large that it eventually had to come out semi-annually.</p> 
 <p>At the age of 35, Elbert Hubbard sold his interest in the Larkin
 Company for $75,000 in 1893. He retired to become a noted author and art
 appreciator. In 1895 he established the Roycrofters, an old-world community of
 artisans and craftsmen in East Aurora (now the Roycroft Inn). Hubbard and his
 wife died in 1915 when a German U-boat torpedoed the ship they were sailing on
 --the Lusitania.</p> 
 <p>With the retirement of Elbert Hubbard in 1893, several corporate
 changes were made. J. D. Larkin Sr. became Treasurer; his son, J. D. Larkin
 Jr., became Assistant Treasurer; and L. T. Mudge was eventually made corporate
 attorney. Business records of the period also frequently mention H. H. Larkin,
 H. H. Heath, H. M. Esty, W. R. Heath, D. D. Martin (made corporation
 Secretary), and department bosses E. A. Becket, G. C. Boulton, Mr. Wing, and
 Mr. Heckman. The company was reorganized in 1899 and took the official name of
 the Larkin Soap Company.</p> 
 <p>In 1894 the Combination Box costing $6 was phased out in favor of a
 $10 version that proved more efficient and profitable to both the customer and
 the producer; it featured freight payments pre-paid by Larkin. About this time,
 the mail order business was considerably expanded: the company encouraged the
 proliferation of "Larkin Clubs" of ten housewives, each contributing one dollar
 each month to result in the purchase of one Combination Box and a prize lottery
 (thus increasing the acceptability of buying on an installment plan). Premium
 lists by this time included lamps, desks, chairs, stoves, furnishings for
 bedrooms, dining rooms and libraries. </p> 
 <p>By 1900 the Larkin Soap Company was credited as one of the largest
 of its kind in the world. In 1900-1901 fittingly sponsored the construction of
 a building at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. </p> 
 <p>1901 also saw the establishment of a noted Larkin subsidiary,
 Buffalo Pottery, with an initial capitalization of $50,000. Filling
 institutional pottery orders, editions for the Larkin premiums and special runs
 of commemorative china, Buffalo Pottery is still a viable industry in western
 New York today.</p> 
 <p>By 1901 the Larkin Soap Company enterprises occupied some 16 acres.
 In 1904 it was reorganized and renamed the Larkin Company. At the company's
 height in 1904, it opened its noted Administration Building at 680 Seneca St.,
 designed (in both structure and interior furnishings) by Frank Lloyd Wright in
 his first commercial venture. The building's offices housed over 1,800 clerks
 and typists. Larkin real estate holdings grew from 29 acres in 1904 to 50 acres
 in 1907 to 64 acres in 1914. </p> 
 <p>The Larkin Company is perhaps best noted for its innovations in
 personnel management. It offered employees a company gymnasium and a choral
 society; it purchased a $90,000 pipe organ to play background music for its
 workers in the Administration Building; it sponsored concerts; and it gave an
 annual company picnic at the J. D. Larkin St. homestead in Evans Center, N.Y.
 (The estate later became a retreat for nuns, named D'Youville on the Lake,
 though some Larkin family members still live on it or adjacent to it on Evans
 Center Road.) </p> 
 <p>Besides publishing an employee magazine called 
 <title type="journal">Ourselves</title>, which contained company
 notices, announcements of awards, news and local events, the company in 1919
 instituted a cooperative employee ownership plan which allowed employees to
 share in company profits according to salary, service, and war record.
 Employees were also given discounts on Larkin products.</p> 
 <p>In 1921, the company was reorganized to become the Larkin Company,
 Incorporated. In 1926, J. D. Larkin Sr. died and his son J. D. Larkin Jr.
 assumed the company's directorship. Around this time, the listed number of
 Larkin premiums and offers continued to rise but Larkin sales began to drop.
 Some described the quality of Larkin premium goods as questionable and inferior
 for gift-giving. (Nevertheless, premium products today show exceptionally high
 quality and are of great value.) The Larkin Company declined gradually until
 the majority of the business was sold in 1942. The new owners kept the Larkin
 mail order business alive in the Larkin Warehouse on Seneca St. until 1962.</p>
 
 <p>In 1950 the acclaimed Larkin Administration Building, having been
 un-occupied for eight years and severely vandalized as a result, was razed. In
 1967 the Larkin Warehouse -- the very last of the Larkin empire that had been
 comparable to those of Montgomery Ward and Sears Roebuck -- was liquidated.
 (The warehouse is currently the property of an interest known as Graphic
 Controls.)</p> 
 <p>The importance of the Larkin Company to the industrial and economic
 development of western New York cannot be overestimated; providing thousands of
 local jobs and making, a special effort to buy their raw materials and other
 supplies from Buffalo businesses, the Larkin Company is gone but not forgotten.
 Few native Buffalonians haven't known a friend or relative who once worked for
 the Larkin's, or haven't come across a now familiar heirloom: a (once) free
 premium for a soap purchase.</p>

 <p>Darwin D. Martin worked at the Larkin Company from 1878 to 1925,
 serving as secretary of the corporation and member of the board of directors.
 He is noted for his invention of the card ledger system. The Larkin Co.
 manufactured soap and other household products; it was the first firm to give
 premiums and was an early user of mail order door-to-door sales, and the
 installment system. Elbert Hubbard was a partner until 1893. </p>
