   <head>Biographical Note</head>
   <p>Anson Conger Goodyear was born to a prominent family in Buffalo, New York in June 20, 1877.
    After he graduated from Yale in 1899, he began working in his family's lumber business and
    became president of the firm in 1911. His interests extended beyond his family firm to include
    railroads, serving as vice-president of the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad between 1907 and
    1910, and president of the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad Company from 1920 to 1930.</p>
   <p>Goodyear was also known for a patron of the fine arts and collector. Goodyear succeeded his
    father as a director of the Buffalo Academy of Fine Arts and was appointed in 1929 as the first
    president of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He served in that position until 1939
    when he was succeeded by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Goodyear continued serving on the acquisitions
    committee until the 1950s and remained a trustee of the Museum until his death on April 24,
    1964.</p>
   <p>Serving in both World Wars I and II, he ended his service with the rank of major general. In
    1955 Goodyear received the chancellor's Medal from the University of Buffalo for his
    contribution to the Lockwood Library Collection. </p>
