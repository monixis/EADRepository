		<head>Biographical Note</head> 
		<bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
		  <head>A. Conger Goodyear</head> 
		  <p>Anson Conger Goodyear, businessman, military officer, postwar
			 European relief executive and humanitarian, author, founder of the Museum of
			 Modern Art, and collector of modern paintings, rare books and historical
			 manuscripts, was born in Buffalo to Charles W. Goodyear (1846-1911) and Ella
			 Conger Goodyear (1853-1940). The Goodyear family in America is traced back to
			 Stephen Goodyear, a founder of New Haven, Conn. and deputy governor of
			 Connecticut from 1643 to 1658.</p> 
		</bioghist> 
		<bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
		  <head>Parents</head> 
		  <p>His father, Charles W. Goodyear, studied law in Buffalo, was
			 admitted to the bar in 1871, and joined the law firm of Cleveland, Bissel and
			 Sicard (later, Bissell, Sicard and Goodyear after Cleveland was elected mayor
			 of Buffalo). He was a lifelong friend of Grover Cleveland, and the Goodyear
			 family made many visits to the White House during Cleveland's two presidential
			 terms. At the height of his success in the legal profession, Charles W.
			 Goodyear quit to enter the lumber and railroading business with his brother
			 Frank H. Goodyear. They made vast gains from their business operations', which
			 had gotten their start in Pouter County, Pennsylvania Over the years their
			 interests expanded to include the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, Great
			 Southern Lumber Company, Buffalo Susquehanna Coal and Coke Company, Powhattan
			 Coal Company, and other concerns. Ella Conger Goodyear had an abiding interest
			 and talent in music. She was graduated from the Buffalo Female Academy and
			 later studied music in Brooklyn. She traveled extensively with the quartet of
			 St. Paul's. After a serious illness, religion became an important part of her
			 life: in 1907 she founded a bible class, which she continued until 1934, and in
			 1913 she published a book, 
		  <title type="book">The Journey of Jesus.</title> </p> 
		</bioghist> 
		<bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
		  <head>Early Life</head> 
		  <p>A. Conger Goodyear was educated locally at the Misses Hoffman School
			 on Virginia Street, the School of Practice (graduating in 1892), and the new
			 Nichols School. In 1895 he enrolled at Yale, where he was a reporter for the
			 Yale Daily News and a member of The Wolf's Head during his senior year.</p> 
		  <p>After receiving his degree, Goodyear traveled abroad for a time
			 before returning to the United States to begin work in the family's lumber and
			 railroading business. On June 29, 1904 he was married to Mary Forman. With the
			 death of his uncle Frank Goodyear in 1907, he became the first vice-president
			 of the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad as well as second vice-president of the
			 Great Southern Lumber Company. In 1911 he succeeded his father as a director of
			 the Albright Art Gallery (the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy).</p> 
		</bioghist> 
		<bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
		  <head>World War I</head> 
		  <p>As the United States inched closer to joining the Allies in World
			 War I, Goodyear joined in the preparedness effort by attending one of the first
			 military training camps held at Plattsburgh, N.Y. under General Leonard Wood
			 "in the summer of 1915. For the next two years he participated in more military
			 training exercises, marching as Grand Marshall in the Buffalo Preparedness
			 Parade in the summer of 1916.and becoming involved in the efforts of Theodore
			 Roosevelt and William J. Donovan to organize a Buffalo regiment. Just as the
			 United States declared war, Goodyear was assigned to the 307th Field Artillery
			 as a Captain. Soon, however, he was sent to the School of Fire at Fort Sill,
			 Oklahoma, where he was retained as an instructor. From there he went on the
			 Field Artillery Central officers Training School at Camp Zachary Taylor near
			 Louisville, Kentucky, and then was assigned to the 81st Field Artillery
			 Regiment. At last, Goodyear sailed to Europe, hoping to engage in battle -- but
			 he landed at Brest on November 9, 1918, only two days before the Armistice was
			 declared.</p> 
		  <p>Goodyear stayed in Europe as an inspector of American railroad
			 troops. In 1919 President Hoover appointed him as president of the Coal
			 Commission of the Supreme Economic Council for territories that included the
			 former empire of Austria, Hungary and Poland. In August of the same year he was
			 assigned to Upper Silesia as a Commissioner of Investigation and a Chairman of
			 the Coal Committee.</p> 
		</bioghist> 
		<bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
		  <head>Business</head> 
		  <p>In the 1920's Goodyear returned to business. As vice president of
			 the Great Southern Lumber Company he became concerned about the depletion of
			 forest lands, and the company began to explore methods of reforestation.
			 Goodyear's company was one of the first to experiment in these methods on a
			 large scale. When the Bogalusa, Ala. mill shut down, it was feared that the New
			 Orleans Great Northern Railroad would go bankrupt; therefore A.C. Goodyear
			 bought stock in the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad and a merger took place.
			 Goodyear also served as a director of numerous other corporations, including
			 the Gaylord Container Corporation and Paramount Pictures.</p> 
		</bioghist> 
		<bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
		  <head>Art Collecting</head> 
		  <p>During the 1920's Goodyear became increasingly more interested in
			 the world of art, and in collecting in particular. He made several trips to
			 Europe to visit galleries and artists and to acquire paintings and sculpture.
			 In 1928 he moved to New York City, where he established the Museum of Modern
			 Art, which he directed as President during its crucial early years until 1939,
			 when it moved into its famous modern home on West 53rd Street. Around 1939 his
			 reputation as the foremost patron of the modern style was enhanced further when
			 he commissioned Edward A. Stone to build him a house on a hilltop at Old
			 Westbury, Long Island, which was the epitome of modern design (and, for a
			 while, the object of contempt among his wealthy traditional neighbors). </p> 
		</bioghist> 
		<bioghist encodinganalog="545"> 
		  <head>World War II</head> 
		  <p>When World War II broke out, Goodyear once again answered the call
			 to arms. In 1940 he received a commission as Colonel in the New York National
			 Guard and was assigned to organize and command the 17th Regiment. In 1943 he
			 was promoted to Brigadier General. In 1944 and 1945 he served as a
			 representative of the American Red Cross in the Pacific Theater (an experience
			 which Goodyear describes in his memoir 
		  <title type="book">One Wide Expanse</title>). After that assignment
		  Goodyear was promoted to Major General in command of the New York Guard's 1st
		  Division. In January of 1947, Secretary of War Patterson requested his services
		  to tour occupied Germany and evaluate the morale of American troops there.
		  Goodyear's military activities continued even past his formal retirement when
		  he served on the board of trustees of Norwich University, a military academy in
		  Northfield, Vermont, throughout the 1950's.</p> 
		  <p>Goodyear's first marriage ended in divorce. Children from that
			 marriage were sons George F. and Stephen G. Goodyear, and a daughter, Mrs.
			 Theodore Kenefick. In 1950 Goodyear was married to Zaidee Bliss.</p> 
		  <p>Many of A. Conger Goodyear's writings were privately printed for
			 distribution to friends and family members. Most of them can be found either in
			 this collection or in the BECHS library; they include the following titles: 
		  <title type="book">The Museum of Modern Art, the First Ten Years
			 </title>(1943); 
		  <title type="book">John George Milburn Jr.: A Memoir </title>(1938); 
		  <title type="book">[Goodyear] Family History, By a Descendant</title>
		  (194-?); 
		  <title type="book">One Wide Expanse</title> (1946); 
		  <title type="book">The Loq of the Yakima </title>(1903?); and 
		  <title type="book"> Sidelights</title> (1960). The Spring 1961 issue of
		  
		  <title type="journal">Niagara Frontier</title> also features a sketch
		  of his mother.</p> 
		  <p>A. Conger Goodyear died on April 23, 1964.</p>
